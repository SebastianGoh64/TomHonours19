## Importing data & setting class

Originally there was an issue that the final numbers of tweet_id were rounded. This was b/c it was being imported as integer. Used ColClasses to import as character.

Currently having issues with DateTime. No DateTime format, will need to convert to Date format (time is unimportant). Currently imported as character. 

test to cut string down & read as.Date
date_test <- head(raw_tweets$created_at,20)
date_test <- substring(date_test, 1,10)


Corpus transformation will require a dataframe with unique ID at start and text in 2nd column. All other columns will be imported as metadata.
###Current Issues



## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
